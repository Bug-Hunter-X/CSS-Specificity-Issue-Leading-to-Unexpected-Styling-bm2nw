To resolve the specificity issue, several approaches can be used. One is to adjust the order of selectors in the stylesheet to ensure the more general selectors have precedence. Another solution is to increase the specificity of the intended selector by using more specific selectors.  The best approach depends on the context and specific CSS structure.
